        description_main:`For those looking for a different level of adventure, the Bat cave or Chamero Gufa in Pokhara is just perfect. As the name suggests, it is where one can find thousands of bats thriving in the dark, gloomy and moist chambers of the cave. These are mostly Horseshoe Bats, and they are found clinging upside down on the ceilings of the cool (chilly even) and dingy caves. If one’s up for it, they can even explore the complete cave (which takes about 10 minutes) till the end and wiggle their way through a narrow shaft to reach the surface. This cave could get extremely confined, so those who have claustrophobia might want to rethink their visit.

Entry fee is around NPR 150, and you will be given a torch along with it. You can also get a guide for NPR 300 who will take you through the cave. There is one exit point of the cave which is narrow and the cave can get really slippery so be careful.

        description_main:`Mahendra Cave, located in Pokhara, Nepal, is a well-known limestone cave famous for its natural beauty, religious significance, and unique rock formations. The cave was discovered in the 1950s and was named after King Mahendra Bir Bikram Shah Dev of Nepal. It is one of the most visited tourist attractions in Pokhara, drawing visitors who are fascinated by its mysterious underground pathways, stalactites, and stalagmites. Inside the cave, there is a naturally formed Shiva Linga, which makes it an important site for Hindu devotees. The cave is also home to numerous bats, often seen hanging from the ceiling, adding to its eerie yet intriguing atmosphere.The interior of Mahendra Cave is dark, with narrow and slippery pathways, requiring visitors to carry flashlights for better visibility. Although artificial lighting is installed, some areas remain dimly lit, enhancing the sense of adventure. The cave extends deep underground, and explorers must be cautious of low ceilings and uneven surfaces. The best time to visit is during the dry season, as the monsoon rains can make the cave muddy and difficult to navigate.`
